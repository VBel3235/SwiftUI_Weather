# SwiftUI_Weather
This is SwiftUI based weather app. As of now, this app only contains UI portion of the app: background ZStack, main VStack with a few VStacks and HStacks inside. As i go through SwiftUI, i plan to populate this app with real data from OpenWeather API

This app is made as my SwiftUI learning process step, from @SAllen0400 course "SwiftUI Fundamentals"
